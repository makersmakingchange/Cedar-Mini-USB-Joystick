## OpenAT Joysticks
This design is part of the [OpenAT Joystick project](https://github.com/makersmakingchange/OpenAT-Joysticks), a collection of open source designs for digital access and adapted gaming.  


## How to Obtain a Cedar Mini Joystick
There are several options for obtaining the device.
### 1. Do it Yourself (DIY) or Do it Together (DIT)

This is an open-source assistive technology, so anyone is free to build it. All of the files and instructions required to build the Cedar Mini Joystick are contained within this repository. Refer to the Maker Checklist below.

### 2. Request a build of this device


A limited number of these devices may be available at no-cost to people with disabilities that reside within Canada. If you think this applies to you, please send an email to info@makersmakingchange.com.

Once the device is finalized and published in the Makers Making Change library, it will also be possible to submit a build request to have a volunteer maker build the device. As the requestor, you are responsible for reimbursing the maker for the cost of materials and any shipping.
<!---
If you would like to obtain a Cedar Mini Joystick , you may submit a build request through the [MMC Library Page](https://makersmakingchange.com/project/Cedar-Mini-Joystick/). The requestor is responsible for the cost of materials and any shipping.

## Getting Started

### 1. Read the Makers Checklist

The Makers Checklist contains a list of tasks to complete to build the device.

### 2. Order the Off-The-Shelf Components

The [Bill of Materials](/Documentation/Cedar_Mini_Joystick_BOM.xlsx) lists all of the parts and components required to build the Cedar Mini Joystick. The main switch component needs to be ordered online. The rest of the off-the-shelf components are also online or may be available in smaller quantities at your local hardware store or dollar store.


### 3. Print the 3D Printable components

Print the components needed for the Cedar Mini Joystick. Make sure to ask the user if they would like any of the optional prints such as toppers or mount adapters.

All of the files and individual print files can be in the [/Build_Files/3D_Printing_Files](/Build_Files/3D_Printing/) folder.

### 4. Assemble the Cedar Mini Joystick

Reference the [Assembly Guide](/Documentation/Cedar_Mini_Joystick_Assembly_Guide_v0.9.pdf) for the tools and steps required to build each portion.
